# Stress, Balance, and Remote Work: An Industry Analysis

## Introduction: Remote Work and Employee Mental Health
As remote work becomes more common, it's crucial to understand how it affects employees' mental health. This analysis examines the relationship between remote work and mental well-being across various industries and job roles. Our study explores key questions like:

- How does working from home influence stress levels in different industries and roles?
- What is the link between work hours, stress, and job types in remote settings?
- How does remote work affect productivity in various job roles?
- Are there differences in work-life balance between fully remote, hybrid, and on-site setups?

The dataset provides insights into work arrangements, stress levels, work-life balance, and mental health, helping companies design strategies to better support employee well-being in remote or hybrid environments.
